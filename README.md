# Text-Classification-of-Medical-Transcript

Medical domain is in a data rich environment that a variety of knowledge can be extracted for positive outcomes. This paper will show multiclass classification of medical transcript using a real dataset. The objective of this paper is to classify medical transcript based on the medical specialty labels, namely Discharge Summary, Neurosurgery and ENT. Text normalisation has been performed on the dataset and five different n-gram feature representations are extracted. Moreover, three supervised learning classifiers are trained on each of the n-gram feature representations, namely K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The classification performance is evaluated by the metric score of macro F1. The best score achieved is 0.93 macro F1 on testing set using tuned Random Forest and unigram feature vectors
